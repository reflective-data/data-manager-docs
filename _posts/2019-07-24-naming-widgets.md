While you can name your widgets however you like, we have put together a structure we find works the best in most cases.

The general idea is to include as much context as possible in the shortest form, so the person who is using the dashboard knows exactly what they are looking at.

_You can rename your widgets at any point._

We recommend using the following structure for naming your dashboard widgets:

`[metrics] / [dimensions] / [period]`

Here are a few examples:

* Revenue / Source / 30 days
* Sessions & Users / Daily / 30 days
* Transactions / Device Category / 60 days
* Sessions & Transactions / Source/Medium / 30 days
```
